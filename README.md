Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms

As the banking industry faces increasing competition and higher customer expectations, accurately predicting customer churn has become a critical factor for banks in their efforts to retain customers and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
The objective of this project to predict if a bankâ€™s customer will stay or leave the bank.
The project involved analysis of the bank customer churn dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and predictions are made with different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest,SVM,XGBoost This is the jupyter notebook code and I've got the data set from Kaggle Website.
Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1.Logistic Regression 2.Random Forest Classifier 3.Support Vector Machine 4.XGBoostClassifier
